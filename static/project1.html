        <h4>Selections:</h4>
        <p>For the prototyping phase, I chose the trivia quiz phone app and the piano floor idea. The quiz app seems like a good idea to make the process of waiting in line much more enjoyable, and would distract people from the actual waiting in line. In addition, people could compete against each other and socialize as a result. I liked the piano floor idea because again, it would be a fun way for people to distract themselves from the monotony of waiting in line, while getting to play music by dancing around.</p>

        <h4>Testing:</h4>
        <p>Testing in line in the dining hall (lines were very slow due to the scanners being broken). One user thought he could speak the answers 
          in.</p>

        <h4>Feedback:</h4>
        <p>Everyone I talked to liked the idea, and thought it was a fun and simple way to make the process of standing in line much more bearable. They liked the idea of it being a game, and also seemed to like the potential for learning due to the quiz aspect of the game. Some of them gave some rather good suggestions for improvement as well:</p>
        </br>
        </br>
        <ol>
          <li>One user though it would be cool to be able to speak the answers in rather than have to press   buttons, and also would’ve liked different styles of questions.</li>
          <li>Another user thought it would be nice to be able to play in solo mode also, rather than be  forced to compete.</li>
          <li>A third user would’ve liked to see different locations having different high score lists, i.e.  someone could hold the high score at CVS while someone else holds the high score at Chipotle.</li>
          <li>Another user would’ve liked to be able to select quiz subjects, rather than just have a bunch of  general trivia questions.</li>
          <li>Another user would’ve liked it if they could just log into some sort of system at the store, rather   than having to download a dedicated app.</li>
